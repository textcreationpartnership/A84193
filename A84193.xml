            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:123847:3"/>the right hand, and ſo next unto them, which was the Lord Generall's Regiment, and the Lord <hi>Brooks,</hi> led on by Colonell <hi>Ballard</hi> who commanded that Brigado, forced that ſtand of Pikes, and wholly broke thoſe two Regiments, and ſlew and took almoſt every man of them: The Earl of <hi>Linſey,</hi> his Son the Lord <hi>Willoughby,</hi> and ſome other perſons of note are pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, Sir <hi>Edmund Varney,</hi> who carried the Kings Standard, was ſlain by a Gentleman of the Lord Generalls Troop of horſe, who did much other good ſervice that day, and the Standard ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, which was afterwards by the Lord Generall himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered unto his Secretary Mr. <hi>Chambers,</hi> with an intention to ſend it back the next day unto His Majeſty; but the Secretary after he had carried it long in his hand, ſuffered it to be taken away by ſome of our Troopers, and as yet we cannot learn where it is: The other two Regiments of our Rear; Colonell <hi>Hollis,</hi> and Colonell <hi>Ballard</hi> charged thoſe which were before them, and then the whole Body of the Kings Foot, except two other Regiments ran away: by this time it grew ſo late and dark, and to ſay the truth, our Ammunition at this preſent was all ſpent, that we contented our ſelves to make good the Field, and gave them leave to retire up the Hill in the night: But before we come to this, we will give you an accompt of what paſſed in the other parts of our Army, before our Rear came up to charge. Our Battle at the very firſt wholly disbanded and ran away, without ever ſtriking ſtroke, or ſo much as being charged by the Enemy, though Colonell <hi>Eſſex</hi> himſelf, and others that commanded thoſe Regiments, in chief did as much as men could do to ſtay them; but Colonell <hi>Eſſex</hi> being forſaken by his whole Brigado, went himſelf into the Van, where both by his direction and his own execution he did moſt gallant ſervice, till he received a ſhot in the thigh, of which he is ſince dead: Now for our Rear, thus it was; before it, towards the outſide of it ſtood our left Wing of Horſe, advanced a little forward to the top of a Hill, where they ſtood in a Battalio lined with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Muſquetiers, 400 out of Colonell <hi>Hollis</hi> Regiment, and 200 out of Colonell <hi>Ballards;</hi> but upon the firſt charge of the Enemy they wheeled about, abandoned their Muſquetiers, and came running down with the Enemies horſe at their heels,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:123847:4"/>and amongſt them pell mell, juſt upon Colonell <hi>Hollis</hi> his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and brake through it, though Colonell <hi>Hollis</hi> himſelf, when he ſaw them come running towards him; went and planted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf juſt in the way, and did what poſſibly he could do to make themſtand, and at laſt prevailed with three Troops to wheel a little about and rally; but the reſt of our horſe of that Wing, and the Enemies Horſe with them, brake through, and ran to Kine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, where moſt of the Enemy left purſuing them, and fell to plundering of our Waggons, by which many of us have received very great loſſe, and by name, your Servants that now write to you: Notwithſtanding their breaking through Colonell <hi>Hollis</hi> his Regiment, it was not diſmaid, but together with th'other Regiments of that Brigado marched up the Hill; and ſo made all the haſte they could to come up to fight, and got the winde of the Enemy, and came on (if we may ſay it our ſelves, but we muſt do the Souldiers right) moſt gallantly, and charged the Enemy, who were then in fight with our Van, and the right Wing of our Horſe, and as was ſaid before, helpt to defeat the two Regiments forementioned, and made all the reſt run, but two other Regiments which retired orderly, and at laſt made a ſtand, and having the aſſiſtance of Canon, and a ditch before them, held us play very handſomly: And by this time it grew ſo dark, and our Powder and Bullet ſo ſpent, that it was not held ſit we ſhould advance upon them; but there we ſtood in very good order; drew up all our Forces both Horſe and Foot, and ſo ſtood all the night upon that place where the Enemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fight had drawn into Battalio, till toward morning that the Enemy was gone, and retired up the Hill: And then we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned alſo to a warmer place neer Kineton, where we had quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the night before, for we were almoſt ſtarved with cold in that bitter night, our Army being in extreme want of Victualls: And about nine or ten of the clock drew out again into Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio, and ſo ſtood three or four hours, till the Enemy was clean gone from the Hill, and then we drew again into our quarter, and there have lain this night, and purpoſe this day, God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, after we have buryed our dead, to march to Warwick to ref<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
